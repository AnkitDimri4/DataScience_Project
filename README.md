# Neural Network for Image Recognition of Letters A, B, and C
This project demonstrates a simple neural network trained to recognize images of letters A, B, and C using Python and NumPy.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of three images: 
- **A**: Represented as a list *a*
- **B**: Represented as a list *b*
- **C**: Represented as a list *c*
Each letter is encoded as a binary image in a 1-dimensional NumPy array format.
## Labels
The labels for the images are:
- A: [1, 0, 0]
- B: [0, 1, 0]
- C: [0, 0, 1]
## Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 30 neurons (corresponding to 30 pixels in each image)
- **Hidden Layer**: 5 neurons, activated using the sigmoid function
- **Output Layer**: 3 neurons (one for each letter), activated using the sigmoid function
## Training
The neural network is trained using backpropagation with gradient descent -
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Activation Function**: Sigmoid
Training Parameters:
- Learning Rate (Î±): 0.1
- Epochs: 100
## Results
After training for 100 epochs, the neural network achieved an accuracy of 95.67% on the training dataset.
## Usage
To use the trained model for prediction:
```python
predict(x[2], w1, w2)  # Image is of letter C
predict(x[1], w1, w2)  # Image is of letter B
predict(x[0], w1, w2)  # Image is of letter A
```
